                    The Finance and Investment Committee approved a tuition freeze for the 2022-23 academic year and reported positive financial prospects for the University’s investments at their Oct. 29 meeting.<br><br>

                    The Committee approved President Suresh Garimella’s proposed budget, covered in a Sept. 15 Cynic article. The budget kept most costs and fees flat, including the fourth consecutive year of a freeze on tuition costs.<br><br>

                    “We’re not doing this because we’ve got tons of money,” Garimella said. “We’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do in the long term.”<br><br>

                    The Committee is pleased with enrollment rates, Chair Don McCree said. Garimella said he was thankful UVM admitted the largest first-year class this fall. Having consistent tuition is imperative to maintaining enrollment rates, the Committee said.<br><br>

                    “From a competitive standpoint, it’s really, really important to be containing the cost of attendance,” McCree said.<br><br>

                    The Committee reported $750 million in total endowment assets, a $188 million increase from last quarter, according to the endowment web page. This increase is due in part to an outside gift to the financial portfolio, McCree said.<br><br>

                    UVM gained more revenue from the 2021 fiscal year than expected, letting the committee take less from the University’s reserves, said Richard Cate, vice president of finance and administration. <br><br>

                    The Committee also discussed various increased costs during the recent fiscal year, including utilities and higher spending on research.<br><br>

                    The Committee changed the adviser to the investment committee from Cambridge Associates to Prime Buchholz. Both are financial investment consulting companies, according to their websites.<br><br>

                    Prime Buchholz has access to investments that Cambridge Financial Services doesn’t, McCree said. This transition is still in progress but is expected to conclude by the end of the year.<br><br>

                    The Committee plans to increase private investments and decrease public investments over a several year period, McCree said. This transition was driven by changes in the market, Self-Perpetuating trustee David Aronoff said.<br><br>

                    The trustees were concerned about the food supply and staff shortages within UVM dining halls and eating locations, McCree said. The staff turnover rate this year was 18%, compared to the usual 6%. <br><br>

                    The Committee recognizes the shortage of workers is a global problem not contained to UVM, Cate said. Some board members have been meeting with Sodexo to discuss ways to improve staffing, including increased student workers. <br><br>

                    The meeting was adjourned 15 minutes early when no further comments or questions were introduced.
