                    The UVM Board approved the Wilbur Trust Fund grant awards during their Oct. 29 meeting at 11:30 a.m. <br><br>

                    The purpose of the UVM Board is to elect successors to fill vacancies among their members. The Board has nine self-perpetuating members including a chair, vice chair and a secretary, according to their website. Each of these positions are elected every May.<br><br>

                    The 2021-22 Wilbur Trust Fund awarded 171 Vermont high school students with grants ranging from $296 to $13,421, Chair Jodi Goldstein said. The money given totalled $868,762.<br><br>

                    The Wilbur Trust Fund is a program that distributes grants to Vermont high school students for their morals, their dedication to education and their financial abilities to receive the education, according to the committee meeting itinerary.<br><br>

                    Students who receive the grant are informed their money is contingent on board approval, Goldstein said.<br><br>

                    The board approved the money unanimously. <br><br>

                    The total money available for grants has increased from $21,216,148 July 2020 to $27,044,275 in July 2021, Goldstein said. <br><br>

                    At 11:40 a.m. the UVM Board went into executive session for the remainder of the 30 minute meeting. <br><br>

                    Executive sessions are closed sessions in which the chair, along with an administrative liaison, are given discretion over whether any non-trustees are allowed to remain in the session, according to UVMâ€™s board of trustees <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/trustees/communications-trustees-and-access-board-meetings"><u>website.</u></a><br><br>
